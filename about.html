                   <h2>Who AM I?</h2>
                   <p>I am Aleksandar Bozinovic, one weird and simple guy born in Zajecar, Serbia. Photography is actually one of the many ways which can document my moods and life experiences. Art is the reason that has led me to photography, providing me with a chance to give you a peek into my silly life. Actually it's a funny story. When I was about 18 years, old my father bought a DSLR Camera because some guy from Bulgaria told him that it would be good for business &#40;but when I did exacly the same, he would not listen&#41;. I noticed that the camera was sitting in a dusty corner of our old house in the mountains. Since nobody used it, I took it and used it to make some cash of shooting high school proms, so I could visit Exit Festival for the first time in my life. Afterwards I started shooting everything, from sports, travels, to jewlery and electronic music events&#40;Techno&#41;. Beside photography, I'm also involved in clubbing.rs, a Serbian No. 1 site where you can find the most recent info regarding parties and festivals all across Serbia, and enjoying it, since electronic music has been one of my biggest pleasures in last 5-6 years. Also I should mention that I study Information and Communication Technologies in Belgrade, and that I love traveling. You can find all of my adventures on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/webber922">instagram page</a>. Cheers!</p>

                    <h3>INSPIRATION</h3>
                    <p>Pictures are like music to me, one has to feel and to storify them. They are my call for freedom. I’d always rather be, where I’m not [currently]. Restless. On the scout. I take pictures of my own longing for more. For remoteness. For whats not within reach. With the photographs I want to create something that stays. Something that survives. Something someone in 30 years will find on their attic. I’m not looking for an answer of questions I never asked- the indeterminate excites me too much. Imagine the ocean had been entirely explored, or the galaxies. That compares to an end. It means to stop dreaming. [And] when I take pictures [or] look at them, I’m exactly at that place, where there are no questions anymore.</p>
